# Voice-Recognition-on-MInDS-14-Dataset

## Introduction:
Voice Recognition is a technology that allows machines to interpret and process human speech. With advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in deep learning, voice recognition systems have become more accurate and efficient in understanding spoken language.

## Why Voice Recognition Matters?
- `Accessibility`: Enables voice-controlled assistants for individuals with disabilities.
- `Automation`: Enhances smart home devices and virtual assistants.
- `Security`: Used in biometric authentication and secure transactions.

### Background:
Speech-to-Text (STT) technology has become a key component in voice-based applications, enabling seamless interaction between humans and computers. As the demand for accurate and efficient speech recognition systems grows, there is a need to address the challenges associated with recognizing speech across various accents and dialects. In the context of English, the diversity of accents and dialects presents significant hurdles for traditional speech recognition models.

### Problem Statement:
The primary challenge in speech recognition is the ability to accurately transcribe spoken language into text, especially when dealing with different accents and dialects. This project focuses on developing a robust Speech-to-Text model for American English (en-US) using the Whisper model, which is known for its high accuracy and efficiency.

### Role of Artificial Intelligence:
Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in enhancing the accuracy and adaptability of speech recognition systems. By leveraging AI techniques, we can fine-tune pre-trained models to better handle the nuances of different accents and dialects. The Whisper model, developed by OpenAI, is particularly well-suited for this task due to its ability to generalize across various languages and accents.

### Objectives:
1. **Develop an accurate speech recognition model for American English (en-US).**
2. **Analyze the effectiveness of audio data preprocessing techniques.**
3. **Evaluate the performance of the Whisper model after fine-tuning.**

### Tools and Technologies:
- `Dataset:` MInDS-14 (PolyAI/minds14)
- `Model:` OpenAI Whisper (whisper-tiny)
- `Frameworks:` PyTorch, Transformers, librosa
